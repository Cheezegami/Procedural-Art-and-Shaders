## Pros and Cons of using Proc.Gen.
### Pros :
A lot of workload is reduced and seemingly infinite possible combinations are possible.
Creates a lot of replayability, because there's always new things to see and encounter.
Reusablity of Assets & Compression can make your game's file size very small, while containing huge amounts of content.
Adaptability, proc.gen can be used to modify meshes and create variations of objects that would normally take a huge amount of time to build.
Variation in builds and content, games with procedurally generated weapons often bring a new depth to gameplay as they've got more diverse weapons to choose from. (Borderlands, Starbound, Dead Cells).

### Cons :
A lot of things start to look like the average and humans will see to start patterns in your generation algorithm.
Hard to encounter something that's truly visually unique.
You lose the authority over a currated experience, since things are so flexible and some users may have an experience that deviates from the intended experience.
Building the right tools takes up time and technical experience.
Testibility, It's more difficult to test every potential use case of procedural content.
